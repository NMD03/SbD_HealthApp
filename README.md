## Documentation
You can find the full documentation required for the project submission [here](./Documentation.md)

## Starting App in Development Mode
Before starting the app in development mode, make sure you have installed Docker and Docker Compose on your machine. If you haven't, you can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Create .env.dev file
Create a file called `.env.dev` in the root directory of the project. The file should contain the following environment variables:

```bash
