## Prerequisites
### Python Environment
We used `Python 3.10.0` for our project. So make sure you have the right python version installed:
```
python --version
```
if the right version is installed you can create the python virtual environment. For that head into the Project directory and run the following commands:
1. **Create the environment:**<br>
	On Windows:
	```
	py -m venv env
	```
2. **Activate the environment**<br>
	On Windows:
	```
	env\Scripts\activate.bat
	```
	On Unix or MacOS:
	```
	source env/bin/activate
	```
	After successfully activating the environment your command prompt should display `(env)` in front of your path.
3. **Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`**<br>
	After activating the environment you can install all the python packages needed with the following command
	```
	py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
